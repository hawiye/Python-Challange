# Python-Challange
In this python challenge, I have analyzed two csv files:
    1st PyBank file
      This  Python script analyzes  budget data and provides the following results:
            The total number of months included in the dataset            
            The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period            
            The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes            
            The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period            
            The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

    2nd PyPoll file
        This Python script analyzes election voting data from a CSV file and generates a report containing the following:
            - Total number of votes cast
            - A list of candidates who received votes
            - The percentage of votes each candidate won
            - The total number of votes each candidate won
            - The winner of the election based on the popular vote
Both scripts are also made to write the output into a text files.
